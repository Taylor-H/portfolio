My professional web development\n              experience goes way back to the mid '90s in Pasadena CA. I got my\n              introduction to the internet at one of the first ISP's in the LA\n              area, Earthlink. I started in Technical Support helping people all\n              over the country get connected to the World Wild Web. It wasn't\n              long before I moved to supporting our commercial and corporate web\n              hosting clients. That's where I learned to make web sites that\n              were more than static pages.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div id=\"photo1\">\n            {/* <img src=\"images/port6.jpg\" className=\"head-shot\"/>  */}\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item two\">\n          <div id=\"photo1\">\n            {/* <img src=\"images/port6.jpg\" className=\"head-shot\"/>  */}\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div id=\"para\">\n            <p id=\"summary-text\">\n              By the end of the '90s I was working on ground breaking technology\n              at internet start ups including{' '}\n              <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RioPort\">\n                \"the first internet music service (cloud service) to legally\n                offer digital songs from all the major music labels\".\n              </a>{' '}\n              The precursor to{' '}\n              <a\n                href=\"https://variety.com/2001/digital/news/mtvi-rioport-big-5-pact-for-downloads-1117796560/\"\n                alt=\"another RioPort article\">\n                iTunes *\n              </a>{' '} among others. I had quickly become a Front End guru primarily\n              integrating graphics, data, and code for the web browser. I\n              enjoyed a successful and rewarding career until 2005 when I took\n              some time off to start a family. Time kept doing what time does\n              and due to circumstances I was not able to continue my career for\n              a very long time.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div className=\"creative\" id=\"para\">\n            <h5 id=\"detail-header\">My Journey</h5>\n            <p id=\"summary-text\">\n              {' '}\n              Flash forward to 2018, my family commitments eased I began to look\n              into coming back to my previous occupation. The advent of hand\n              held devices like tablets and phones, social media, streaming\n              platforms had all come about in the time I was away. I wanted to\n              get back to building websites and web applications but I really\n              didn't know where to start. I turned to General Assembly in\n              Boston. I was able to refresh my HTML and CSS skills and I was\n              introduced to GitHub.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div id=\"photo1\">\n            {/* <img src=\"images/port6.jpg\" className=\"head-shot\"/>  */}\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item two\">\n          <div id=\"photo1\">\n            {/* <img src=\"images/port6.jpg\" className=\"head-shot\"/>  */}\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div className=\"creative\" id=\"para\">\n            <p id=\"summary-text\">\n              Back in the day I knew enough Javascript to allow me to add some\n              interactivity or check that a form was filled out correctly. When\n              the pandemic started I finally had the opportunity to take some\n              time and go in depth with software development and computer\n              science in general. I really focused on Javascript. When I felt\n              I'd gotten far enough I moved on to the data part. I was able to\n              learn PostgreSQL and Sequelize. I learned not just how to display\n              data but how to structure, verify and have save it for later. I was then\n              able to make <Link to=\"\">a basic CRUD app</Link> with NodeJS and\n              Express.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div className=\"creative\" id=\"para\">\n            <h5 id=\"detail-header\">Currently</h5>\n            <p id=\"summary-text\">\n              The seven or so years of prior Front End experience was not for\n              nothing. The interpersonal and communication skills I gained from\n              that experience are certainly still relevant. Working on a team\n              and being able to translate technical concepts to non technical\n              team mates is always going to be a useful skill. I may have had to\n              learn a lot of new technologies to be able to make modern web apps\n              but it was so worth it. It's a great feeling to be able to create\n              something that actually does something. Something that improves\n              peoples lives and helps them to achieve their goals. It's a great\n              feeling to be able to say I'm a Full Stack Software developer.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item one\">\n          <div id=\"photo1\">\n            {/* <img src=\"images/port6.jpg\" className=\"head-shot\"/>  */}\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item\">\n          <div id=\"photo1\">\n            {/* <img src=\"images/port6.jpg\" className=\"head-shot\"/>  */}\n          </div>\n        </li>\n        <li className=\"flex-item\">\n          <div id=\"para\">\n            <p id=\"summary-header\"></p>\n            <p id=\"summary-text\">\n              I currently live near Boston with my family, our cat, and an\n              extremely energetic dog.
